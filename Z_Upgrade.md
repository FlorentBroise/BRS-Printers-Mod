## -/ Z SYSTEM 3.0 (For Vcore 4)

# -/ Z SYSTEM 1204/1605 3.0

Adaptation of the production grade "Z-Upgrade" for VCORE 4.0
Upgrade to replace the original Z with a ballscrew system.
More precise, very reliable over time, offers a very high repeatability in the Z movement compared to a trapezoidal screw.
Maintenance-free*. Made to last in a production line. No wobble over Z. Proofed design over 2021. More than 350+ users since 2021.
A Reinforced version of the 1605 is available too for heavy duty projects. This system has virtually no Z limitations in size, you can dream of the best you can pick ;)

A lot of things has been reworked on this iteration compare to the previous Z-Upgrade 2.0:

-Simplification of parts list, easier implementation. direct bolt in upgrade.

-Directly bolted to the VCORE 4.0 frame and underplate. Re-use the Stock VC4 top retainers (1204 version) + bearings.

-No need of surelevation; the Stock VC4 feet will only need to be adjusted to the height. (+17mm)

-Compatible natively with Wobble X, Oldham V3 proofed printed rings compatible too

-Dense integration of the Oldham/Wobble X in the Arms

-Motor reduction for a very high holding torque, even when the motor aren't active. Proofed for heavy custom bed, or bigger custom print volume machines. Vcore 500 can now run standard Nema 17 without risks of fall when the motor are powered off

-Motor reduction + ballscrew allowing an insane precision over the Z-Motion, extreme constistency, allow thin and repetable layer over time

-No maintenance needed (cleaning+thin lubrication once a year is enough)

-Z-motors easy tension over the 6mm timing belt with 1x M5 screw

-Add +10mm of Z distance (Oldham V3), or +15mm with Wobble X

-All included, no self soucing to do.
