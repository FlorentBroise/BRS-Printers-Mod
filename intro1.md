# The VULCAIN 

Vulcan is an ancient Roman god, whose parents are Juno and Jupiter.
God of iron and fire, and therefore of blacksmiths, the hammer is his attribute. He was identified with the Greek god Hephaestus.
As a Mythology lover, this name is self explainable

This Machine is a mix of every mod/upgrade I developped/worked on, and found relevent to make a Industrial effective machine, 
with the best longevity, repetability and low maintenance, with a lot a glam of course time
It has been developped in mind to be scaled safely to 1200mm^3, maybe more

Partially based on the Vcore COREXY system, The new Z system is made upon the Hevorts kinematic bases, with an overall huge rework. 
All BRS previous parts concerning the PMB, L3VER are compatible with it. 
A standard VCore can be used to buil it, but will require few modification concerting the Frame, in other things

The machine is actually sitting in my workshop, waiting to make the very first move.
What is actually done:

-Vzbot toolhead integration with Takoto HE20 Hotend
-Piezo integration in the Vz toolhead (the bigest challenge)
-Z kinematic is finished and fonctionnal

Once the Machine will be validated, something you can follow on the BRS Facebook page, I will realease the CAD, for free, and add kits in the BRS STORE!!
This should happen until the end of September 22! All VULCAIN parts and design are under CC BY-NC 4.0

I see you there :)
